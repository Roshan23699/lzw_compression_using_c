The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large,
square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing – for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to

had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a non-
existent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a
flowerbed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of
someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and

heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps,
